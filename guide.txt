what needs to be done 
synchronize the two clients - the moves on both should look the same 
so in details: 
when doing a move sending a message to the server, the other client should get it trough the server and render the move 

**what are the most urgent problems now and how to fix them**
1. most important - fix the sync of the moves, the moves are already being sent and we can handle them BUT the issue is that because the 
board and the pieces use the same numbers system (1,7) etc for example, in both sides, when i send a move and say that i moved a white piece
from (1,7) to (2,7) to client2 his two lists of pieces are the opposite of mine, so he will not even have a white piece in (1,7) - so we need to 
somehow convert those moves so that they have the same meaning on both sides. 
2. right now we can only move the horses and play with them basically, because of the hardcoded moving options - we need to fix those (so that 
pawns and other pieces know the directions they are allowed to move)
